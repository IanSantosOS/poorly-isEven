# Poorly isEven File

A Code that creates a file called isEven.js with lots of if & else

## Why?

It all started when I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCm5Gi0vMGA) from the channel [Theo - t3.gg](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg), where the creator of the post, Andreas, created a program that generated a bunch of if and else statements to check whether a number was even or odd in the most optimized way possible.

My program isn't even close to being as optimized, it's the first time I've tried to use file creation with pure Node.js, reasons:

1. Node is just not for this
2. I really don't tried to optimized this much

and to be quite honest, this was actually fun to make :)
